# Spring Boot Application

## Spring Boot

Spring Boot is an open-source Java-based framework used to create stand-alone, production-ready applications with minimal configuration. It is built on top of the Spring Framework and simplifies application development by providing features such as:

- Auto-configuration to reduce manual setup.
- Embedded servers (Tomcat, Jetty, Undertow) for self-contained deployment.
- Production-ready features like health checks, metrics, and logging.
- Easy integration with databases, messaging systems, and cloud services.

## Spring Boot MVC

Spring Boot MVC (Model-View-Controller) is a module of Spring Boot that simplifies building web applications using the MVC design pattern. It is built on top of Spring MVC and provides:

- Built-in support for RESTful APIs.
- Automatic configuration for web applications.
- Annotation-driven development with `@Controller`, `@RestController`, `@RequestMapping`, etc.
- Integration with templates like Thymeleaf and JSP.
- Easy handling of form submissions and validation.

Spring Boot MVC is widely used for developing modern web applications with clean separation between business logic, user interface, and data handling.
